				  <p>When I joined the course, my ambition was to gain more knowledge in computer science. But fortunate enough I am very proud of what I have achieved so far. I never imagined that I can sit down and correct and enhance my own project or someone else project. I have gained many skills in Software Design and Engineering, Data structure and algorithms, and Database management.</p>
				  
<p>Code review also known as peer review is a process conducted on software programs with the aim of improving the program by checking and eliminating quality problems. Besides that, there are many other goals for code review including finding program defects, improving internal code quality, finding better solutions and many others.</p>

<p>Talking on my behalf, code review has enabled me to gain a lot in software engineering, data structures and algorithm, and Database management. In the process of code review, I was able to come across logical errors and some blocks of codes that needed modification which is difficult to see during the software development process. Though I used my own project, it was like a project developed by other programmers, this was as a result of the few things I had gained during my first days in the course.</p>

<p>
During the code review process, I came to realize that, code review is not just meant for checking for bugs and correcting them but also making sure that the coding style is consistent throughout the project life cycle. And this is very helpful, most of the times a project may be distributed to several developers, let’s say each one is allowed to use his/her coding style, the program will unavoidable become disjointed. Maintaining consisted coding style enhance readability to others and also it becomes easy for other developers to join the team since the project code is easy to read and understand.</p>

<p>Furthermore, code review minimizes project mistakes and their impact. During the project development process, no matter how many times programmers go through his/her program codes, there are very high chances that some coding mistakes may be left behind, in most cases logical errors which cannot be detected by the development tools. Such mistakes can be easily identified when the project is given a fresh set of eyes which is through code review.</p>
<p>
In addition to that, code review is meant to ensure project quality and meeting the requirements. The success of a project depends mostly on the written down requirements. When the program meets all the requirements then it means it is meeting the needs of the company or people who want to use the program. Setting fresh eyes on the project will always make sure that the project really meeting the set down requirements.
Using the Farklerules C++ game as my project in code review, I enhanced my skills in programming. As far as my course is concerned, I had to choose software design, data structures and algorithms and finally database management as the areas of study for the code review. I successfully review my project and apart from correcting some logical errors, organizing my code to fit a specified coding style, I was able to enhance it in a different way as it will be discussed below.</p>
<p>
I chose this project since it’s my favourite, learning code review gave me a chance to go through it deeply and check it if there are any limitations, corrections in code structure and also if there are ways I can enhance its working. Also after some days of learning in this course, I learned that I had made several mistakes in this project. Therefore I gave myself a chance to correct these mistakes.</p>
